## **The Basics**:  

If you could send electronic money directly to other people, you could avoid banks. But real-world dollars disappear from your wallet if you give them away. How would the electronic money make sure you didn't copy-and-paste it before you gave it away? How would it make sure you didn't keep it for yourself *and* send it? You could use an electronic bank—but then you wouldn't be avoiding banks.

Bitcoin's idea is to use electronic stamps—not on each bit of electronic money, but on each transaction: each time you send some to another person. Then it collects all those stamps—all the ones from money you've sent, plus all the ones from everyone else sending money—and lines them up in a long list. This list is like a chain—a "blockchain." Every link in the chain is made out of a set of the electronic stamps. And every link in the chain is very strong, so it's hard to remove a link once it has been added. This helps make sure that people can't steal or cheat. Computers add links to the chain by solving complicated math problems. The math problems turn the electronic stamps into a secret code, which is what makes the links so strong. The process of solving problems to make links in the chain is called proof-of-work.
