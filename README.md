# plain-language-whitepapers

In progress. A collection of cryptocurrency whitepapers translated into plain language. 

My goal is to help interested, non-technical individuals gain a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies. I will translate headings and text. I won't include code snippets, graphics, or other non-textual elements. I'll reference these elements as appropriate in my versions.

## Principles

I'll use the following principles of plain language and global English in my translations.

The basic principles of plain language are widely understood and documented. But if you're unfamiliar, read the [SEC's useful plain-language handbook](https://www.sec.gov/pdf/handbook.pdf).

- Sentence length
- 

I'll be using as many as possible, except ones that pertain to design elements like font size or page dimensionsâ€”these are out of my control since I'm writing plain-text documents and posting them on a GitHub repository. However, the combination of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and GitHub's own design decisions results in readable documents that largely follow these principles.

## Roadmap

Here's my tentative roadmap for translations. It's subject to change at any point based on my own interests or feedback from users. The links direct to the whitepaper versions I intend to use. Submit a pull request to this page if there's something
