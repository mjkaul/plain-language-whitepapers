# plain-language-whitepapers

In progress. A collection of cryptocurrency whitepapers translated into plain language. 

My goal is to help interested, non-technical individuals gain a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies. I will translate headings and text. I won't include code snippets, graphics, or other non-textual elements. I'll reference these elements as appropriate in my versions.

## Principles

### Plain language 

The basic principles of plain language are widely understood and documented. But if you're unfamiliar, read the [SEC's useful plain-language handbook](https://www.sec.gov/pdf/handbook.pdf). They stress the following plain-language principles, among others:

- Write short sentences (ideally <20 words)
- Use definite, concrete, everyday words
- Write in the active voice
- Use tables or bullet lists for complex material whenever appropriate
- Avoid jargon, especially legal jargon and highly technical business terms

These are the sentence-level principles that will be most important to my plain-language writing. But plain language also requires more significant acts of judgment:

- Determining who my audience is and writing to them. 
- Determining what content is significant to that audience, and ruthlessly eliminating everything else.
- Striking a balance between objectively conveying facts and providing moral judgments or reaching conclusions. 

I certainly won't be providing financial or investment advice. But my interest in this world is fundamentally bound up with moral judgments that are very important to me: decentralization, creating economic opportunity, building an open internet that serves everyone, resisting the walled gardens and perverse incentives of major social-media platforms. 

That said, a fundamental goal of the plain-language whitepapers will avoid my own perspectives and judgments. My goal is to simple *translate* the esoteric jargon and specialized knowledge into something that anyone can understand.

### Global English

Global English significantly overlaps with plain language. The goal of Global English is to maximize English writing for non-native speakers and for translators (including machine-based translators like Google Translate).

The principles of Global English were thoroughly compiled by John Kohl in his book [*The Global English Style Guide*](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL13620739W/The_global_English_style_guide?edition=globalenglishsty00kohl). I'll be deploying these principles as well. They won't conflict with the plain-language principles articulated above, but they will help to make the text more readable and translate-able for non-English speakers.

## Roadmap

Here's my tentative roadmap for translations. It's subject to change at any point based on my own interests or feedback from users. The links direct to the whitepaper versions I intend to use. Submit a pull request to this page if there's something
